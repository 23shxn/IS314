# IS314 Project - Current Tasks

## Task Analysis
After reviewing the commit history, I can see that there was a "comments" commit (da8ee78) that was later reverted (7dd7573). The revert removed a README.md file and some other changes. Looking at the current state of the repository, I need to understand what the actual requirements are.

## Current Status
From examining the repository, I can see:
1. There are two TODO files: TODO_new.md and TODO_updated.md
2. TODO_updated.md appears to be more current as it has more completed tasks
3. The database configuration has been updated to use port 5434 instead of 5433
4. There's a new AdminReservations component that was added

## Next Steps
1. Determine which tasks from TODO_updated.md still need to be completed
2. Identify any issues with the current implementation
3. Create a proper README.md file with project documentation
