# TODO List - Change Password Feature Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Create ChangePassword.js component with form requiring current password verification
- [x] Add route `/admin/change-password` in App.js for the new page
- [x] Add "Change Password" link in AdminLogin.js login form
- [x] Implement authentication flow (login first, then change password)
- [x] Add proper validation and error handling
- [x] Style the component to match admin login page design

## Testing Tasks
- [ ] Test the change password page functionality
- [ ] Verify it works for both admin and super admin roles
- [ ] Test error scenarios (wrong current password, network errors)
- [ ] Test successful password change flow
- [ ] Verify redirect back to login after successful change

## Notes
- The page is public (no login required) but requires current password verification
- Uses existing backend `/api/admin/change-password` endpoint
- Form includes email, current password, new password, and confirm password fields
- After successful change, user is redirected back to login page
- Component uses same styling as AdminLogin.js for consistency
